 These programs incudes important Linked List Knowledge including deleting nodes and reversing Linked list.

 As for the program Term.c, this program uses a linked list of struct nodes to count the occurrences of text lines. It utilizes the dynamic memory management library to allocate nodes dynamically, and the string processing library to handle string comparison and operations for the text lines.
 
 Moreover, the term2.c program is able to reads multiple lines of text from standard input, inserts each line as a string into a linked list, and then outputs all the strings in the linked list. The purpose of the l_find function is to check whether a string already exists in the linked list before inserting a new string. This avoids duplicate strings in the linked list and ensures that all strings in the list are unique.

In the file, TermFre, it contains a word counting program that reads text from a file, calculates the frequency of each word, and outputs the results to the "f1.out" file.
